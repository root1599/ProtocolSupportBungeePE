ProtocolSupportBungee
================

Forked version of ProtocolSupportBungee that allows Bedrock (Pocket Edition, Windows 10 Edition, etc.) clients to join your java server.
This plugin is under development

Important notes:
* Only latest version of this plugin is supported
* This plugin can't be reloaded or loaded not at BungeeCord startup
* **Make sure to use the compiled version of ProtocolSupportPE found [here](https://github.com/HoiTemmieColeg/ProtocolSupportPE/releases) if you want Bedrock support.**

---

ProtocolSupportBungee is a passthrough protocol plugin, not a converter, so servers behind BungeeCord should also support those versions

Also servers behind Bungeecord should support https://github.com/ProtocolSupport/ProtocolSupport/wiki/Encapsulation-Protocol

The preferred setup is to put ProtocolSupport to all servers behind BungeeCord
